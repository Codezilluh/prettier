#### Added Front Matter to Handlebars (#17781 by @Codezilluh)

Front matter can now be used in Handlebars code. If it is YAML front matter, it will be formatted as such.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```hbs
---
title: My page title
keywords:
  - word
  - other word
---

<h1>{{title}}</h1>
<ul>
  {{#each keywords}}
    <li>{{this}}</li>
  {{/each}}
</ul>
```
